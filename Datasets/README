For the project we have used three datasets, all belonging to Amazon Review Data.
A variety of data was available, of which we chose ‘Rating-Only’ datasets,
which contained at most four columns (User, Item, Rating, Timestamp). 
Other available datasets contained reviews, images and other metadata.

Datasets were too large to upload. Please use the following links.
