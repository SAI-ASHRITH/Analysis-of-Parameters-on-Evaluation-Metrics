#### Description

##### Datasets: 

There are 3 different datasets considered from Amazon Ratings Datasets which can be looked at in Datasets folder:

###### 1. Books Dataset

###### 2. Electronics Dataset

###### 3. Movies and TV Dataset

##### Visualizations and Graphs:

The Graphs folder contains all the graphs related to all the 3 datasets based on 4 algorithms used for the analysis - SVD, NMF, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor.

##### Source Codes (Jupyter Notebooks):

###### 1. The notebook CMPE_256_Master_EC.ipynb is the jupyter notebook that contains the preprocessing as well as all the results from the models used on Electronics Dataset.

###### 2. The notebook CMPE_256_Master_MTV.ipynb contains the preprocessing as well as all the results from the models used on Movies and TV Dataset.

###### 3. The notebook CMPE_256_Master_BK.ipynb contains the preprocessing as well as all the results from the models used on Books Dataset.
